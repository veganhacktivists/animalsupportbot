# animalsupportbot

Reddit bot that replies with the most relevant counterargument to debunk common anti-vegan myths.

It replies to a parent comment when summoned via mentions.

# Bot Usage

The bot can be summoned using mentions, which means replying to the comment the bot should respond to with `/u/animalsupportbot` somewhere in the reply.

For example:

```
Non-vegan user: <Comment with myth(s)>
   └── Vegan User: /u/animalsupportbot
		└──	animalsupportbot: <response>
```

## Argument hinting

The bot can be helped to match up arguments by 'hinting' in the summoning process. This is done by putting in a helpful phrase/keywords in the summoning reply:

```
Non-vegan user: <Comment with myth(s)>
   └── Vegan User: /u/animalsupportbot plants feel pain. vegan pets
		└──	animalsupportbot: <response, using hints to match more easily>
```

# Requirements

Requirements can be found in `requirements.txt`

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Instructions

## (Step 0) Get knowledge base from GDrive 

(This step only applies to VH members who have been given access to the knowledge base)

To get the freshest version of the myths and examples from Google Drive, we will need the `gdrive-keyfile.json` in this directory which grants access to the spreadsheet.

Once this is in the repo directory, simply run:

```sh
python update_knowledge.py
```

This will add `myths.csv` and `myths_egs.csv` to the `./knowledge/` directory.

Alternatively, these can be downloaded and exported from the Google spreadsheet to csv from the following link (with `myths.csv` being the Myths sheet and `myths_egs.csv` being the Examples sheet):

### [Animalsupportbot Knowledge Base](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1epSnuOAhkv97UDs3NPAUtYMBNUzRo783GizPrADY4T8/edit?usp=sharing)

## (Step 1) Pre-compute embeddings

```sh
python argmatcher.py
```

This populates `./preload_dicts/` with pickles of the precalculated embeddings for each sentence in the examples and responses. This assumes the presence of `myths.csv` and `myths_egs.csv` in the `./knowledge/` directory.

## (Step 2) Run reddit bot

To run this step, `./local_info.py` must exist in the repo directory. This contains the secret keys etc. to authenticate with the Reddit API. It looks something like this:

```py
USER_INFO = {
              "client_id":"XXXXXX",
	      "client_secret":"XXXXX",
	      "password":"XXXXX",
	      "user_agent":"XXXXX",
	      "username":"animalsupportbot"
	    }								               
```

Once this exists, the reddit bot can be run with the following command:

```sh
python redditbot.py --refresh-rate <int> --threshold <float> --hint-threshold <float> --n-neighbors <int>
```

- `refresh_rate` is an `int` that determines how long the bot will sleep for after checking mentions, in seconds.
- `threshold` is a `float` that determines the minimum similarity score that an input sentence must have to be declared a succesful match.
- `hint-threshold` is a `float` that determines the minimum similarity score that an input must have to be declared a succesful match **to a hinted argument**.
- `n-neighbors` is an `int` that determines how many neighbors to consider in the weighted vote argument classification.

The typical command I recommend running is:
```sh
python redditbot.py --refresh-rate 60 --threshold 0.6 --hint-threshold 0.4 --n-neighbors 3
```

# Testing the Argument Matcher

After Step 1 has been completed, meaning embeddings have been precomputed, the argument matcher can be tested on the command-line using the following:

```sh
python argmatcher.py --test
```

This starts an interactive mode which can test various input sentences, for example:

```
Enter test sentence: but bacon though
Num neighbours with vote: 3
[{'input_sentence': 'but bacon though',
  'matched_arglabel': 2,
  'matched_argument': 'I Love How Animals Taste!',
  'matched_text': 'but bacon though',
  'reply_text': 'I think one of the most disconcerting things about the taste '
                'excuse though, is that it is an excuse that bluntly admits '
                'that the personal desires of an individual’s taste preference '
                'matter more than the morality surrounding an animal’s life '
                'and unquestionably horrific death. However, it doesn’t mean '
                'that the person using this excuse necessarily believes that '
                'their taste preferences are more important than an animal’s '
                'life (most people I talk to don’t) but because they’ve never '
                'been asked about it before they’ve never had to confront the '
                'fact that through their actions they are placing their taste '
                'higher. This is why when people say to me “I love the taste '
                'of meat.” or, “I could never give up cheese.”, I like to ask '
                'them “do you value your taste buds higher than the life of an '
                'animal?” - most people will say no, but if they do say yes '
                'make sure to ask them why. One of the big issues with this '
                'excuse is that it seeks to validate a non-vegan diet by '
                'claiming that we shouldn’t be held responsible for our '
                'immoral activities because our selfish impulses are too '
                'strong to be suppressed and as such, we can’t be held morally '
                'accountable for the actions that we make. But where do we '
                'draw the line?',
  'similarity': 1.0}]
```
