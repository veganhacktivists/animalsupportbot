When it boils down to it, the number one reason people eat animal products is because they enjoy the taste - I know I certainly did, in fact like most people I loved the taste of animal products. I think one of the most disconcerting things about the taste excuse though, is that it is an excuse that bluntly admits that the personal desires of an individual’s taste preference matter more than the morality surrounding an animal’s life and unquestionably horrific death. 

The question is: “do you value your taste buds higher than the life of an animal”? If the answer to this is yes, one of the big issues with this excuse is that it seeks to validate a non-vegan diet by claiming that we shouldn’t be held responsible for our immoral activities because our selfish impulses are too strong to be suppressed and as such, we can’t be held morally accountable for the actions that we make. But where do we draw the line? Would this argument hold up in court if a murderer in their own defence said, “but I could never give up murdering because I enjoy it too much.”? It requires more than sensory pleasure to morally justify something - and the inconvenience people go through by giving up cheese, for example, is not even remotely comparable to the pain a dairy cow goes through being forcibly impregnated repeatedly, having her children taken away from her and being painfully pumped for her milk before she becomes too weak and is sent off to be slaughtered. 

I think one of the reasons why as vegans we find this excuse a really difficult one to hear is because it doesn’t matter whatever product people claim they could never give up or enjoy the taste of, the difficulty and the inconvenience that it would be for them to no longer eat animal products is minuscule compared to the pain, suffering and fear that the animals have to go through. A non-vegan meal lasts for 15 minutes, but the death of an animal is eternal. What food could ever be worth taking the life of an individual? An individual that felt fear, an individual that felt pain, an individual that felt confused and couldn’t understand why such intolerable suffering was being committed against them? The fear of death is not unique to humans. Most of us fear dying and hope it will happen peacefully, surrounded by the ones we love without pain. The scariest thing we can think of is being tortured and ultimately murdered. We make horror films about this concept and it gives us nightmares. But this isn’t a horror film for the trillions of animals that are slaughtered each year, it isn’t some nightmare that they will wake from. It’s real, the pain, the fear, it is all real - and then they die and they are gone forever.

We need only put ourselves in the position of the animals, as they look up at the human who’s about to murder them and imagine their fear and confusion, to understand why taste can never justify this incomprehensible atrocity. For example, is it morally justifiable for someone to kill a dog if they like the taste?
