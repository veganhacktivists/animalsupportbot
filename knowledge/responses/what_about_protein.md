The myth that it is impossible or difficult to consume enough protein in vegan diets is incorrect. It is a long standing misconception that stems from a lack of understanding of science and nutrition.

All of the essential amino acids our bodies need can be found in plants, with some plants such as soya (which includes foods such as tofu, tempeh, soya milk and edamame), quinoa and buckwheat containing all the essential amino acids [1]. However, you can get all the essential amino acids through food combinations as well, such as rice and beans, hummus and pita bread or a wholewheat peanut butter sandwich. It is generally not difficult to obtain enough protein as long as you eat enough food [2].

How much protein do we need? It is generally recommended that most adults eat about 0.75 to 0.8 grams of protein per day per kilogram of body weight, which on average means about 46 grams for a woman and 56 grams for a man. Consuming more protein than your body needs does not provide any benefits because the excess protein is converted into and stored as fat. In fact, the available evidence suggests that there may be bad consequences for doing so [3]. It is not difficult to consume the required amount of protein through plant foods; for instance, a peanut butter sandwich contains about as much protein as three ounces of beef or three large eggs [4].

Another common myth is that plant proteins are "lower in quality" compared to animal protein. Studies comparing muscle gain from plant and animal protein have shown that there is no significant differences [5]. In fact, roman gladiators were vegetarians [6] and several athletic and strength world record holders completed their records as vegans, and more athletes, powerlifters, and bodybuilders are seeing continued improvements after switching to a vegan diet. Some of these athletes include Olympic weightlifter Kendrick Farris, strongman Patrick Baboumian, Olympic cyclist Dotsie Bausch, and Formula One's Lewis Hamilton [7].

In a review of 32 studies about protein intake that included more than 715,000 participants who were followed for periods ranging from three and a half years all the way to more than 30 years, plant-protein consumption was associated with an 8 per cent lower risk of all-cause mortality, and in the case of mortality from heart disease there was a 12 per cent lower risk [8].

In conclusion, not only is protein not a concern in vegan diets, there are many benefits to be gained from replacing animal protein with plant protein.
