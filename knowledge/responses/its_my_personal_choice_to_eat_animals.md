“Respect my opinion!”, “It's my personal choice to eat meat, don't force your views on to me!” - of all the excuses used to defend eating animal products, this could well be the most common. So is eating animals a personal choice or is it a little more complex than that? This is quite an interesting excuse as arguably it is a choice, one does actively choose to eat dead flesh and animal secretions, the same way that a domestic abuser actively chooses to abuse their partner or a rapist actively chooses to commit rape. 

Using this logic it would then be morally justifiable to beat a dog or kick a cat, as it is a personal choice to do so. In this situation ask the person, “if someone makes the personal choice to abuse a dog, does that make it morally justifiable?”. The problem is when non-vegans use this argument they have either become so detached from the fact that their animal products came from a living being, or they hold animals with such little regard that they don't consider the lives of their food worthy of contemplation because they think the consumption of animal products only affects them as individuals. 

So when a vegan seeks to educate a non-vegan we are met with “you should respect other people's points of view”. However, as vegans we do respect the views of others. We respect the views of the 56 billion land animals murdered each year that didn't want to die. We respect the views of the dairy cows and egg-laying hens whose bodies are sexually abused and exploited and treated as nothing other than a disposable commodity. We respect the views of the 2 - 2.7 trillion fish and marine animals that are dragged out of their natural habitat every year and suffocated or crushed to death. We respect the views of animals skinned alive for their fur or abused, tortured and killed for their skin, wool and feathers. We respect the views of the animals callously tested on by scientists and cosmetics companies, confined to a life of agony and unbelievable pain. We respect the views of the animals beaten and punished to perform circus tricks and unnatural behaviours for our entertainment. We respect the views of every animal that is oppressed, tortured and murdered. We respect the views of the humans who are also victims within our systems of animal exploitation - and we even respect the view of the person we are talking to, the view that they probably want to live a long life by caring enough to tell them that consuming animal products hugely increases their risk of cancer, diabetes, strokes, dementia, heart disease and every other major disease plaguing our species. 

So when people so defiantly tell us to respect the views of others, the question is, which other view point are they considering other than their own? When they declare it's their personal choice to eat animal products, what about the personal choice of every other creature, human and non-human alike, whose life is treated as inferior and meaningless just so people can poison their bodies with products created from their death and fear? It is not morally justifiable to murder just because the murderer personally made the choice to murder. It is not morally justifiable to rape just because the rapist personally made the choice to commit the act of rape. It is not morally justifiable to kick and beat a dog just because the abuser personally made the choice to kick and beat the dog and it is not morally justifiable to pay for animals to be exploited and killed, just because a non-vegan personally made the choice to pay for animals to be exploited and killed.
