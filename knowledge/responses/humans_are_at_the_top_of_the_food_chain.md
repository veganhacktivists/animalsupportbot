The food chains within nature are incredibly important, they symbolise something that is part of the natural order and exists within an eco-system. They help to maintain healthy populations of animals and ensure that the natural ecology is balanced. 

What we do to animals when we selectively breed, artificially inseminate, mutilate and farm them, before driving them in trucks to the slaughterhouse where we hang them upside down, kill them and drain them of their blood is about as far removed from nature as possible and does not resemble anything like a food chain. 

The food chain that we have created for ourselves is a human construct to try and conveniently justify an entirely unnecessary act - it ignores the complexity and interdependent web of life that forms our ecosystems. It is an appeal to nature fallacy that overlooks our ability to make moral decisions and instead claims that our actions are predetermined for us entirely by biological determinism. It is a concept that we have conveniently constructed to assert and confirm our position as the dominant and most powerful species. It allows us to slaughter trillions of animals every year under the illusion and defence that it is a part of the natural world. We believe that because we have placed ourselves at the top of a hierarchical system we then have the right to exploit any we deem beneath us. 

Every human atrocity committed has come under the illusion of self-appointed power, whether it be Nazis believing they are superior to Jewish people, white people believing they are superior to black people, one religion believing they are superior to another religion or humans believing that they are superior to animals. The food chain excuse adopts the ‘might means right’ way of thinking, with people believing that because we have the physical ability to enslave and exploit others we are then morally justified to do so. But being in the position of power means that we have a responsibility to care for the vulnerable, we have a moral obligation to care and look after those weaker or less able than we are. 

The food chains in nature exist because they have to. The predator needs to kill the prey to survive. We don’t have to kill anyone to live, which means that we don’t have to use our dominance to kill others, we can use our power to look after others and create a better world - in fact, we have a moral obligation to. As humans we have moral agency, which means that we can make decisions based on a notion of right and wrong and most importantly we can be held accountable for the actions that we make. Our moral agency dictates to us that when we are in a situation where we have the choice to not inflict unnecessary suffering we can and should be held accountable if we actively choose to inflict unnecessary suffering instead.
