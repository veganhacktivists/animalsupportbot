Both dogs and cats can be vegan! 

Dogs really have no issue being vegan at all, and the reason why cats historically couldn't be vegan isn't related to their intestines, but rather to the fact that they lack the genes necessary to synthesize vitamin D, B12, vitamin A, taurine, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid.

As long as any vegan food is supplemented with those things and has a high protein/fat content and a low carbohydrate content, there's no other physical reason they can't be vegan.

The term obligate carnivore is only relevant when talking about wild animals because it's related to their nutrient requirements in a diet they could naturally acquire in the wild, but because we can give cats supplemented and appropriately designed food, it's not an issue in domesticated animals. (I've linked to a vegan cat food that does just this at the bottom).

Finally, I'd like to cite some studies that support supplemented vegan cat and dog food.

 - ["[A] significant and growing body of population studies and case reports have indicated that cats and dogs maintained on vegetarian diets may be healthy—including those exercising at the highest levels—and, indeed, may experience a range of health benefits. Such diets must be nutritionally complete and reasonably balanced".](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/6/9/57)

 - "[Wakefield and colleagues (2006)](https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.229.1.70) compared the health of 34 cats maintained on vegetarian diets for at least a year, with that of 52 cats maintained on meat-based diets for at least a year. There were no significant differences in age, sex, body condition, housing, or perceived health status, with most cats described as healthy or generally healthy. These results are hardly surprising, when we consider that animals need specific nutrients, not ingredients. There is no scientific reason why a diet comprised only of plant, mineral and synthetically-based ingredients cannot be formulated to meet all of the palatability, nutritional and bioavailability needs of the species for which it is intended."
