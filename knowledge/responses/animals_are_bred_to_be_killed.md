I’ve always struggled to understand how we have granted ourselves the right to decide what purpose another living being has. I think it perfectly demonstrates just how much we have victimised and devalued non-human animals.

The truth is, just because we have decided what will happen to an animal doesn’t mean what will happen to them is morally justifiable. Many people breed dogs into existence with the sole purpose of raising them for dog fighting, does that mean that dog fighting is moral because those animals were bred for that purpose? In some countries it is (or was until recently) legal to have sex with an animal and there are even animal brothels, where you can pay to rape an animal [1]. Using the ‘bred for a purpose’ excuse it must therefore be perfectly moral to have sex with an animal in a brothel as those animals were bred with that purpose in mind. 

This argument also completely avoids the fact that the animals that we exploit have a preference to live their life and wish to avoid feeling pain and fear, in their eyes they have no awareness of the reason they were bred and their desire to live is exactly the same as an animal that was born without a ‘purpose’ for humans.
