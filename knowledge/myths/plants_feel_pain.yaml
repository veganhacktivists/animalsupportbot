examples:
- what if plants feel pain
- plants feel pain too
- how do you know plants don't feel pain
- Don't forget them being protectors of life, plants are alive as they reproduce, do respiration, grow and have cells to name a few things so they are still alive, just because they don't speak doesn't mean they aren't alive. I think we should become Nagevs, people who shall protect plants from being eaten as they are still alive!
- Mycoproteins are millions of tiny animals, but they'll happily rename them as 'quorn'
- Nah, vegans are allowed to pick and choose which life forms have value.
- Well, plants are also alive and get killed to be eaten, so, doubtful.
- I wonder how the vegans are going to react to the fact scientists have proved plants have sentience. Eating plants is murder
- Plants have feelings too.
- I was told plants don't have brains, therefore no central nervous system, therefore they cannot feel pain. Despite me linking one of my FAVOURITE documentaries, "What Plants Talk About". It's fascinating, how plants communicate, decide what/where/how/when they grow, etc.
- I've heard the screams of the vegetables
- Plants are living and breathing too.
- TIL plants are never alive and don't breathe.
- Well when it comes to plants like wheat, barley, oats, canola etc. they do actually feel pain
- Plants can feel pain.
- why do you eat plants and not animals?
- Look at all those poor plants that were once connected to a living fungal network that spans most of the planet had to be murdered for their profit and their stomachs how dare they,what an absolute disgrace it is that people can do that to the poor wee plants.
- Plants have nervous systems and can feel pain and communicate with one another
- Looks like those plants are people too
- But it has cotton from plants which are also alive
